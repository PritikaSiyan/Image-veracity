        <h1>About ImageVeracity</h1>
        <p class="about-description">
            ImageVeracity is a web-based AI-powered application designed to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. 
            As synthetic media continues to evolve, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify deepfakes and manipulated visuals. 
            Our tool leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on diverse datasets to analyze images and provide 
            accurate predictions.
        </p>

        <p class="about-description">
            The motivation behind ImageVeracity stems from the growing concern over misinformation and digital image manipulation. 
            By offering a simple and accessible interface, we empower individuals, journalists, educators, and researchers to verify 
            the authenticity of visual content.
        </p>

        <p class="about-description">
            This project integrates technologies such as TensorFlow, Flask, and MobileNetV2, optimized for performance and accuracy. 
            ImageVeracity aims to raise awareness and provide practical tools in the fight against AI-generated disinformation.
        </p>

        <p class="about-description">
            Whether you're curious about image authenticity or concerned about digital trust, ImageVeracity is your gateway to a more 
            transparent visual internet. Our goal is to make AI explainability accessible and to highlight the line between creative 
            generation and harmful manipulation.
        </p>

        <p class="about-description">
            In future iterations, ImageVeracity will include features such as historical metadata scanning, region-based anomaly detection, 
            and side-by-side AI vs. human analysis visualizations. We're committed to transparency, education, and supporting ethical AI practices.
        </p>

        <p class="about-description">
            This platform was built by developers and researchers passionate about protecting digital integrity. We believe in an open web where 
            users can easily distinguish reality from fabrication using intuitive and trustworthy tools.
